## DAGON - An Adventure Game Engine

### Description

Dagon is a game engine developed by Senscape especially tailored for adventure
games and based on open technologies. Featuring a simple scripting language,
blazing fast performance and high portability supporting Windows, Linux, Mac
OS X and iOS devices, the project aims to become a reference of the genre. Dagon
is completely free to use.

_**Please note:** The engine is still under heavy development and script
compatibility breaking changes may be introduced until version 1.0 is released._

### Installation

Dagon can be built using Premake, a straightforward configuration system:
http://industriousone.com/premake

For more details on how to build on your specific system, please refer to
[premake4.lua](premake4.lua).

### Running

We always recommend downloading the official Dagon binaries for deploying your
games: 
https://github.com/Senscape/Dagon/releases

You may use the readily available _Asylum Interactive Teaser_ for testing, which also serves as an advanced and highly in-depth tutorial. It can be downloaded
from Senscape's website:

Its source code is also available in the following GitHub repo:
https://github.com/Senscape/Asylum-Teaser

To create your own project, copy the Dagon binary in a folder with a _main.lua_
file or indicate the name of your main script in the
[Dagon.cfg](Sample/Dagon.cfg) file included in the _Sample_ folder.
