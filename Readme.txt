Dagon is a game engine especially tailored for adventure games and based on open technologies. Featuring a deceptively simple scripting language, blazing fast performance and high portability supporting Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and iOS devices, the project aims to become a referendum of the genre.

The source code is first and foremost distributed as an Xcode project for Mac OS X. It should compile right out of the box on 10.6 Snow Leopard or 10.7 Lion as all libraries are provided.

A Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express solution is available in the Windows folder and is also ready for compiling.

Compiling on Linux is possible provided all the required libraries are available (see Credits in the Documents folder). Simply create a project that compiles all the *.c files in the Dagon and Other Sources folders except DGSystemWindows.c. Official support for Linux is not provided yet.
